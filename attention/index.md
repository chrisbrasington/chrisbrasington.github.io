# The Smartphone is a Non-neutral influence

It's not your fault when you spend too much time on your smartphone. There are thousands of corporate entities that have designed this rectangle to be as addictive and engaging as possible. This is the `Attention Economy`. And if you don't want to be zombified in the process, then you'll have to engage in a creative sort of mental warfair. 

Here's what you can do about it. Here's how you can stay connected to the friends and information of the internet that enriches your life while disabling the algorithmic feed from view. 

## What does NOT work (for me)

### App Timers
App timers give you a button to ignore and reset at midnight - which is a problem if you stay up. They don't have an option of resetting at say 6AM. 

### Abstinence / Dumb Phone

See [Great Apps to actually use](#great-apps-to-actually-use) - but I think most of us like <i>some</i> components of modern internet life.

## What Works (for me)

### Blocking Algorithmic Feeds

For the most part, I block the algorithmic feed of sites like youtube/reddit, while still having some access to certain areas like subscriptions or subreddits. This is a balance and may not work well for everyone, but this guide is to help by providing detail of that balance.

### Notifications Mostly Disabled
I disable nearly all notifications on my phone except direct contact to a few individuals. Even then, have them enabled on my smartwatch but not my phone, so I can look at my watch without exactly getting sucked into my phone. 

### Phone charger away from bed
A good idea.

# Phone Apps vs Browsers Extensions

Chrome on android does not have extensions. <u>Firefox does.</u> In order to get access to a site like youtube without the algorithmic feed, we have to one remove the app and two use browser extensions to modify the presentation of the site.

Google does not let you uninstall the chrome and youtube app <u>but you can by force.</u>

## Forcibly removing google apps with addictive feeds

To remove chrome and youtube apps from your phone, you first must setup on a PC [Android Developer Bridge (adb)](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) and then run the following commands:

```bash
adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.android.chrome

adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.google.android.youtube
```
# Firefox extensions

| [uBlock-Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin) | Ad blocker. Blocks all ads and unwanted content. |
| [unHOOK](https://unhook.app/) | Disable the YouTube home feed, restrict to subscriptions. Helps reduce algorithmic addiction. Optionally enable the feed once a week for discovery. |
| [SocialFocus](https://socialfocus.app/) | Hide feeds on Reddit and other social sites. Supports Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube. Useful to reduce distraction. |

# Operating System - ditching Windows

# GREAT APPS to actually use

## Android Launcher

# GREAT DEVICES to use that aren't a smartphone

## Gaming Handhelds
A dedicated gaming handheld can provide distraction-free gaming.
